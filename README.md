# Advent of Code
These are my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023).
They are all written by myself (using the [Rust Programming Language](https://rust-lang.org)),
so don't expect them to be the most efficient solutions out here.

## Stuck
I'm currently stuck on [day 3, task 1](https://github.com/hiimsergey/advent-of-code-2023/blob/master/day3/src/one.rs) and just can't find out what went wrong. If you happen to see this and know, feel free to reach out. Thanks.
